## Documentation Index

Use this page as the entry point for all project docs. The repository root now stays clean—only the main `README.md` lives there.

- **Changelogs & completions** → [`docs/changelogs/`](./changelogs/)  
  Feature wraps, fixes, progress updates, and post-mortems (moved from the root).
- **Guides & how-tos** → [`docs/guides/`](./guides/)  
  Quick starts, READMEs, setup guides, checklists, and plans.
- **Runbooks** → [`docs/runbooks/`](./runbooks/)  
  Debugging steps, rollback instructions, troubleshooting notes, and testing guides.
- **API docs** → [`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`](./API_REFERENCE.md) and [`docs/api-specs/`](./api-specs/)  
  Reference and per-provider specifications.
- **Systems** → [`docs/IMAGE_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md`](./IMAGE_GENERATION_SYSTEM.md) and other subsystem docs as added.

### Tips
- Searching for a feature implementation? Check `docs/changelogs/` first.
- Need setup or operational guidance? Look in `docs/guides/`.
- Debugging an incident? Start in `docs/runbooks/`.
